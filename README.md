# Car Driving Lane Segmentation using SAM2

This project focuses on segmenting Cars and Driving Lanes using the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).

## Overview

The repository includes four main scripts:

1. **Car Segmentation**: Segments only cars from the input images.
2. **Driving Lane Segmentation**: Segments only driving lanes from the input images.
3. **Combined Segmentation**: Segments both cars and driving lanes simultaneously.
4. **Results Compilation**: Displays the outputs of the previous three scripts side by side for comparison.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the original image along with its corresponding mask. As shown in the following figure.

## Dataset

For this project, images were selected under foggy weather conditions. These images were manually annotated using SAM2.
